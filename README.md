# admin-dashboard

Hello Fellas

I have designed an admin-dashboard project. I was required to do this project, due to the curriculum of the Odin Project.

I have used html and css to complete this project.

What I have learned:

- I have learned how to use grid to build a layout.
- I have assigned a container as a grid and I have displayed some of    the grid items as a flexbox.
- I have used svgs.
